### Practical 5
---
This practical implements infinite scrolling functionality in the TikTok application using TanStack Query (React Query) with cursor-based pagination. The solution provides a smooth, endless scrolling experience optimized for large video datasets.

### Key Features
**Pagination System**
- Cursor-based pagination for efficient data loading

- TanStack Query's useInfiniteQuery for state management

- Intersection Observer API for scroll detection

- Optimized backend queries using Prisma's cursor pagination

**Technical Implementation**
- Backend API endpoints modified for cursor pagination

- Frontend components updated for infinite scroll behavior

- Loading states and error handling integrated

- Cache management with TanStack Query

### Implementation Steps
Backend Setup
1. Updated video controller for cursor-based pagination

2. Modified following videos controller

3. Implemented "n+1 pattern" for hasNextPage detection

Frontend Implementation
1. Installed required dependencies:
```
npm install @tanstack/react-query @tanstack/react-query-devtools
```
2. Configured QueryClientProvider in layout.js

3. Updated videoService.js for cursor-based requests

4. Created useIntersectionObserver custom hook

5. Refactored VideoFeed component for infinite scroll

### Key Components

### Benefits of Cursor-Based Pagination
1. Better Performance: More efficient than offset pagination for large datasets

2. Consistency: Handles data changes during scrolling

3. Smooth UX: Seamless infinite scroll experience

4. Scalability: Works well with growing video collections

### Testing Guidelines
1. Scroll Behavior:

    - Verify new content loads automatically at bottom

    - Check loading indicators appear appropriately

2. Data Consistency:

    - Test with new videos being added during use

    - Verify no duplicate or missing videos

3. Performance:

    - Monitor memory usage during extended scrolling

    - Check for unnecessary re-renders
