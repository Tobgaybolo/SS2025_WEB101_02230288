# Reflection on Practical 1 : Tiktok

## What I Learned
This practical work was a fantastic learning experience. Here are some key takeaways:
- **Next.js Fundamentals**: I gained a deeper understanding of Next.js, including routing, layout management, and server-side rendering.
- **Tailwind CSS**: I learned how to use Tailwind CSS to create responsive and visually appealing designs quickly.
- **Component-Based Architecture**: I practiced breaking down the UI into reusable components, which made the code more modular and easier to maintain.
- **State Management**: I explored basic state management in React to handle interactive elements like likes and comments.

## Challenges Faced
While working on this project, I encountered a few challenges:
1. **Responsive Design**: Ensuring the layout looked good on both desktop and mobile devices was tricky.
   - **Solution**: I used Tailwind CSS's responsive utilities (e.g., `flex`, `grid`, and `hidden`) to create a layout that adapts to different screen sizes.

2. **Interactive Components**: Implementing interactive elements like the like button and comment section required careful state management.
   - **Solution**: I used React's `useState` hook to manage the state of interactive elements and ensure they updated correctly when clicked.

3. **Dummy Data**: Since I didnâ€™t have a backend, I had to create dummy data to simulate a video feed and user profiles.
   - **Solution**: I created a `DUMMY_POSTS` array with sample data and used it to populate the video feed and other components.

## What I Enjoyed
- **Building Something Real**: It was satisfying to build a frontend that mimics a real-world application like TikTok. I enjoyed thinking through the design and seeing it come to life.
- **Tailwind CSS**: I loved how quickly I could style components using Tailwind CSS. It made the development process much faster and more enjoyable.
- **Interactive Elements**: Implementing features like the like button and comment section was fun and gave me a sense of accomplishment.
